# War Card Game

Welcome to the War Card Game! This project is designed to help kids learn Python by implementing a simple card game.

## Game Rules

1. The deck is divided evenly among the players.
2. Each player reveals the top card of their deck.
3. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
4. In case of a tie, a "war" is triggered:
    - Each player places three cards face down and one card face up.
    - The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards.
5. The game continues until one player has all the cards

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic Python syntax and structure.
- Learn how to use lists and loops.
- Practice writing functions and using conditionals.
- Get familiar with object-oriented programming by creating a class for the game.
